        As a part of my internship within Deloitte's Risk and Financial Advisory group, I was placed on two seperate client projects.
        I am working on an AI governance project for a top US banking company. For this project, I research open-source machine learning models
        to assist in the model risk management pipeline and provide context for AI Governance documentation. On the second project, I am leveraging my
      python and excel skills to identify and review critical data for an emerging fintech company.

          this internship. During the internship I researched natural language processing and machine learning tools, such as support vector
          machines (SVMs) and neural networks to create and improve a recplicable machine learning framework.  The scripts and resources
         for this framework were made publically available to provide future social sceintists with an easy-to-implement tool for article classification.</td>
